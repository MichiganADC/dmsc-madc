The Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) Data Core Sharing Hub is a public platform dedicated to supporting Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias research through the dissemination of data, analytic tools, and knowledge.    

This website is created and maintained by the Data Management and Statistical Core (Data Core) at the [MADRC](https://medresearch.umich.edu/labs-departments/centers/madc/research). The MADRC is a statewide, multi-university collaboration between the University of Michigan, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University housed at the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center [MADC](https://medresearch.umich.edu/labs-departments/centers/madc) at the University of Michigan Medical School. The MARDC Data Core Sharing Hub highlights the impactful work of our team and reflects our commitment to fostering collaboration and innovation in Alzheimer’s research.
