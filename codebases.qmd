This page provides access to code-based protocols developed by the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center’s (MADC) Data Core. These resources include GitHub repositories and Quarto documents outlining our workflows for data management, processing, and analysis.

While underlying data are not shared, these codebases reflect the tools and logic we use locally to support research operations and maintain data integrity across projects.

::: {.callout-note}
**Stay tuned:** Additional code protocols and tools will be added as they are finalized.
