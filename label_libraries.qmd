title: "Label Libraries"

We are in the process of developing a set of standardized label libraries to support consistent variable and value labeling across our datasets. These libraries will be available in formats compatible with commonly used statistical software such as R, SPSS, and SAS.

Our initial focus is on creating a core library covering the standard variables most commonly included in MADC data requests. In the future, we aim to expand this to include form-specific label sets to further streamline data preparation and documentation.

*This resource is under development, check back soon for updates!*
