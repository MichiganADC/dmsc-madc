title: "Request Michigan ADRC Data"
---

This page will provide clear, step-by-step guidance for submitting data requests through the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center’s (MADRC) updated request process. It is designed to support all stakeholders (whether you're a researcher, administrative staff member, or internal collaborator) by outlining each step from submission to data delivery.

We are currently finalizing a new data request portal, which will streamline intake and tracking of requests across teams. Once launched, this page will serve as a central reference for understanding timelines, requirements, and available support resources.

**Coming Soon:** This documentation is under development and will be updated once the new request system is live.
