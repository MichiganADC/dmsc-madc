**Data Requests Are Open**  
While we are actively developing a more comprehensive data request system, requestors can use our current [Resource Application](https://redcapproduction.umms.med.umich.edu/surveys/?s=W79KLR89LA4H4X48) to submit inquiries. Updated documentation and workflow guidance will be added here as the new system goes live.

We are committed to making data from the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (MADRC) accessible and useful to collaborators, investigators, and the broader scientific community.

Our team is currently in the process of developing a more robust, transparent workflow for managing both internal and external data requests. This future system will include clearer guidance for requestors, built-in tracking to support timely responses, and improved coordination across our data and research teams.

In the meantime, we encourage requestors to use our current [Resource Application](https://redcapproduction.umms.med.umich.edu/surveys/?s=W79KLR89LA4H4X48) to initiate new requests. This form helps us gather key information about your study needs, population of interest, and intended data use.

We appreciate your patience as we work toward launching a more comprehensive request and review process. Updates to this page, including documentation of the new workflow, will be shared as development progresses.
