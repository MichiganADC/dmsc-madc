## The Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Center

Established at Michigan Medicine and based in the Department of Neurology, the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center aims to:

* Conduct and support research on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
* Promote state-of-the-art care and wellness for individuals and families affected by memory loss
* Increase dementia awareness through collaborative education and outreach efforts
* Provide training and support to the next generation of clinicians and scientists

## Meet the Data Core

The Data Management and Statistical Core (Data Core), led by Kelly Bakulski, PhD, helps maintain our center's academic and research productivity by integrating and disseminating data to our research investigators. The data core manages data privacy, analyzes data for specific research projects, and facilitates data sharing nationally with the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center.
