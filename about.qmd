## Meet the DMSC

The Data Management and Statistical Core (DMSC), led by [Kelly Bakulski, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/bakulski-kelly.html), helps maintain our center's academic and research productivity by integrating and disseminating data to our research investigators. The data core manages data privacy, analyzes data for specific research projects, and facilitates data sharing nationally with the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center.
